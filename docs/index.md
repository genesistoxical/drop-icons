## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert, subtracting three from preview. If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, wait for the interface to restart because this indicates that it has finished and your icons are ready.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want before clicking the `Convert` button.

- **Format:** Clicking on `Format` will display a menu with two options to choose the sizes that will be included within the icon: **Multiple** generates a high quality icon that include all necessary sizes such as 16, 32, 48, 64, 128 and 256 pixels, although the output dimensions will be 16px. The last option is **256 px** which generates an icon with a single size but look pixelated in the details view.
     >Note: If the **Generate tiny icon** switch is on, a small icon will be created regardless of its format.
