## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert (subtracting three from preview). If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, wait for the interface to restart because this indicates that it has finished and your icons are ready.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want even before clicking the `Convert` button.

- **Change language:** In the **Language** section below, click on the little arrows icon to change between English or Español, finally click on the return button to apply and see changes.

- **Change theme:** Click on `Change Theme` to open the color picker and choose a custom one, then click Apply. To return to the default, repeat the previous steps and press the purple button below the tone selector, finally click Apply.

On the other hand, **256 px** generates icons of a single size but these look pixelated when displayed small.
