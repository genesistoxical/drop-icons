## Preview

## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert, subtracting three from preview. If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, wait for the interface to restart because this indicates that it has finished and your icons are ready.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want before clicking the `Convert` button.

By clicking on the upper Info button, a new window will appear in which you can:

- **Change theme:** Click on `Change Theme` to open the color picker and choose a custom one, then click Apply. To return to default values, repeat the previous steps and press the purple button below the tone selector. Finally click Apply.

- **Change language:** In the **Language** section below, click on the little arrows icon to change between English, Espa√±ol or Deutsch. Finally click on the return button to apply and see changes.

- **Format:** Clicking on `Format` will display a menu with two options to choose the sizes that will be included within the icon: **Multiple** generates a high quality icon that include all necessary sizes such as 16, 32, 48, 64, 128 and 256 pixels, although the output dimensions will be 16px. The last option is **256 px** which generates an icon with a single size but look pixelated in the details view.
     >Note: If the **Generate tiny icon** switch is on, a small icon will be created regardless of its format.
     
- **Third-party content:** On the left side are the names of each library, project, icons or fonts that were used, click one to read its license and author(s), as well as a short description. You can click on the clip icon to go to each repository/official site and change pages with **Next ü¢ñü¢ñ** or **ü¢îü¢î Back**.

<br>

To choose whether Drop Icons is on top of all windows (Topmost) or not, right-click anywhere in the main window and choose Enable Topmost or Disable Topmost.

## Options

## Installer
To compile the installer you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), the files are located in the [installer src](/installer%20src) folder. You just need to open the project (Installer.iss) and compile it, unless you want to make a change. When finished, it will leave a folder called Output in the same location.

>* Please note that you must first compile the source code in Visual Studio to get the binaries, otherwise you will get a [üìçCompiler Error](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/issues/3).
>* Alternatively, you can download the compiled app from the Drop Icons [page](https://genesistoxical.github.io/drop-icons/).

**Portable with 7zip.bat** allows you to quickly zip the portable version. It only works with [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

Both .iss and .bat get the files that are needed within their folder and/or the Release folder (due to relative paths).

## Contributing
* **HandyControls** package will no longer be updated (for now or permanently) as the latest version does not allow resizing of ToggleButtonSwitch.
* If you make comments in the code, preferably in Spanish, please.
* Variable names must be in English.
* If you open an **Issue**, it can be in English o Spanish.
* **Pull request** in English, in the description you can add details in English or Spanish.

## What's new?
`Version 3.0.0` now has accurate vector conversion. Previously, empty margins weren't detected, resulting in an icon with scaled dimensions: [üìçImage cropped](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/issues/4).

The loading spinner is displayed when one or more images larger than 2MB are added, preventing the interface from looking frozen.

<br>

`Version 3.1.0` includes one more language: [üìçGerman translation](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/pull/6) for both the application and installer. To avoid interface issues, updates for **HandyControls** package have been disabled.

<br>

`Version 3.2.0` includes another language: [üìçSimplified Chinese language](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/issues/8), for app only.

<br>

>‚ú® Special thanks to **uDEV2019**, who added German translation and to **huqiu2** for adding Simplified Chinese.
